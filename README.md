# Arduino
###What is this?
A small Arduino project made by Penguoir and Conition. We're trying to make a robot that draws shapes and perhaps letters defined by the user.

###Stages
1. Build the draw bot.
2. Figure out how to move the draw bot
3. Code some defined shapes to draw
4. Create user input (perhaps with GUI)

###What We've Done
So far, we haven't even started the project. Our first meeting will be held in a secret location, at a secret time. Our draw bot formula is top secret, which is why we're making a public github repository.
